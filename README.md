# SimAVR
Simulation of AVR MCU

## Overfiew
The objective of this project is to create an environment, running under linux,
that will provide the ability to load and execute (to a limited extent) a HEX object
file produced by the Arduino IDE (or other system capable of outputting the HEX
format).

The aim is to provide an environment that will allow the code to be disassembled and
executed instruction at a time, through subroutine calls, or until break points or
conditions are met.

Speed of simulation is not the primary goal.
